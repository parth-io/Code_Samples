This guide is based on my frustuations compilings programs in Linux. All-over-the-place documentation, broken packages, different versions of the same package, heck at times you don't even know what to Google for.

Install build tools like gcc, etc.
Usually sudo apt install build-essential covers it

Also, during the compile process, if bash complains about missing dependencies or missing shared objects, but you have the missing dependency, the compiler might need the "-dev" version of the package.  So add "-dev" to the end of the package name and compile it. So for package "randompackge1.0", install "randompackage1.0-dev"

Also, running ldconfig after installing dependencies might help.
