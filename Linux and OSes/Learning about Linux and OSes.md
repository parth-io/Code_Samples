## Kernel
Kernel - runs in ring 0 or kernel space (https://kali.training/topic/what-is-linux-and-what-is-it-doing/)\

### Hardware
Data about hardware - stored in /proc/ and /sys/\
Applications can access devices via files in /dev/ - /dev/input/mouse0 for mice, /dev/snd/* for soundcards\
Block and character device files - run ls -l /path_to_device\
ioctl command
### File systems
Kernel translates between disk storage locations and the filesystem hierarchy\
Linux makes a single disk the root, other disks are simply mounted\
File system formats - ext4, NTFS, etc.
### Processes
PID number
Multitasking and multiple processor cores
### Permissions

## Command Line

### tty and the GUI
If you cannot access the GUI, use tty.\

### Basics
Bash, zh, sh, ksh\
$ and #\
Bash commands are either shell builtins like `cd` and `pwd` or found at locations designated in the PATH environmental variable\
Environment variables store the global settings for the shell or other programs. They are contextual - each process has its own set of environment variables - but inheritable - shells, like login shells, can pass down variable to other programs they execute.\
Go to /etc/profile to change system settings or user-specific in ~/.profile but variables that are not specific to command line interpreters are better put in /etc/environment, since those variables will be injected into all user sessions thanks to a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) â€“ even when no shell is executed.

## Linux File System

### Filesystem Hierarchy Standard 
### Home
`~`'s value is given in the HOME variable.\
App config files are stored as dotfiles in `~`, increasingly in `~/.config ~/.cache ~.local`.\

### Rights
Giving permissions - `ugo rwx` - https://www.comentum.com/unix-osx-permissions.html\
