**P**rint current **W**orking **D**irectory to show you which directory you are currently in 
### ls

`cd -` - go to former working directory\
If no pathname is specified, `cd` assumes you means the current working directory, i.e., the pathname begins with `./path_to_directory`

## File Commands
### cp

### mv
Move
### rm
Delete file

## Commands to display text files
### cat
To string together or display (**CAT**enate) the contents of files onto the screen 
### less
Variant of "cat" that includes features to read each page leisurely)\ 
In "less", use <space> to move down one page, 'b' to move Back up one page, and 'q' to Quit. You can also use the up/down arrow keys to move one line at a time.
### more
This baby existed before `less`, it has fewer features than `less` and [is slower than `less` as it loads the entire file at once](https://www.tecmint.com/linux-more-command-and-less-command-examples/#:~:text=Learn%20Linux%20'less'%20Command,using%20page%20up%2Fdown%20keys.), but its implementation is only 2000 lines as compared to `less`'s implementation, which is over 25000 lines\
Some systems hardlink `more` to `less`\

### most
Ah, another one purporting to be more than `less`. See [this](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/81129/what-are-the-differences-between-most-more-and-less).
