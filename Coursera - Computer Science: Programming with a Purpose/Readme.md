A collection of my solutions for Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose on Coursera

My solutions received 100% on the whole, a few of them received 95% since I could not be bothered to comply with some of the more retarded requirements in the auto-grader.

Honestly, it was not that hard to hit 100%, just submit your solutions to the auto-grader (which is amazing, by the way) repeatedly, and work on the feedback.

Then, for review and learning, you can look at some other solutions

So far, the hardest assignments are:

Week 3 - Birthday.java, Minesweeper.java 

Week 6 - RevesPuzzle.java (seriously, this one...)

Week 7 - MaximumSquareSubmatrix.java, Inversions.java

Week 8 - Huntingtons.java, KernelFilter.java
