This repository is meant for me as a personal record of my journey into the realm of Computer Science, Mathematics and Software Development. However, to the legions of interested wannabe-programmers, you can use this page as a starting point.

**See the following descriptions of the folders:**

- Beginnings - for the complete beginners to Python and/or coding
- Coursera - Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose - my solutions to the course
- HackerRank - my HackerRank solutions + links to other people's solutions
- Linux and OSes - all about Linux
- Java - my learning resources for Java
- Advanced - incomplete as of yet

Fair warning to the uninitiated - Computer Science, which can be considered a subset of Math, is different from the fairly mundane and now easy-to-automate task of programming. And if you were wondering, learning never stops in CS. From new languages, to new operating systems, to new concepts such as functional programming or the Linux kernel or operating system architecture or linear algebra, if you do not challenge yourself on a daily basis, you are gonna just end up as a code monkey. Harsh truth I am beginning to realise too. 

This repo is in the form of code samples I created when learning CS and coding, and short notes that are intended to serve as a diving platform for deeper studies or for review of the individual's own knowledge of the subject matter. I also am posting collections of resources I have gathered.

My advice is, get started with Python first, then transition to OOP with C++ or Java. Then learn functional programming and others styles of programming in Lisp, Haskell, etc.
Practise coding and participate in online competitions and hackathons to gain some experience.
There are some amazing bootcamps out there, but programming is a largely meritocratic field and students can design their own curriculum at their own pace for free.
Get used to Linux, do not be daunted by the terminal. The terminal is the coolest and snappiest feature of Linux. Period.
Oh, and please support open-source!
